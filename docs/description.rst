Asysync is an open source infinite asynchronous synchronisation tool. It overcomes the web space restrictions of most cloud providers by only uploading and storing changed files in the cloud until all registered machines have acknowledged the download of these modifications. Using this technique, asysync can synchronize an infinite amount of data. However, the ability to access the data through the web interface or web api of the cloud provider is lost.
